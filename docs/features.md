# Features

 - **Modular at foundational level:** work with a `main.py` to serve as the main program and "attach" other code structures (or "modules") to it.

 - **Accept only characters appropriate to each field:** for instance, user's name field should only accept letters.

 - **Further naming treatment:** perhaps, later on, add checks for detecting if it's an actual name and not just random alphabetic letters.

 - **Store information:** Let user store their data in the program. In the long run, users should be able to opt out this, delete, edit and so on such informations.

 - **Retrive information:** Let users get back the stored information.

 - **User friendly UI and installation:** Of course, ideally, we should make this software as much as user friendly as possible.

 - **Cloud storing:** Perhaps we could includes the capability for the user being able to safely guard (and retrieve) these information remotely online.
