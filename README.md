# Py-UltEX Personal Card

## What is this project about?

 In short, it's a simple project about making a form-based program to store and retrieve personal data.

## What "Py-UltEX" stands for?

 It stands for *Ultimate EX*, and "Py-" is just for identifying it as a Python-based project. The series itself is namely set as *Ultimate EX Learning Series*. Alternatively, switching *Learning Series* with *Project* when it turns out not being **only** for learning anymore.

 Why have such glamorous name? Well, in short it's a kind of an identifier for me know what the project is about by just looking the *-UltEx* suffix. Simply as that, so please don't mind it too much.
